ðŸ”¹ What is I/O (Input/Output)?
It refers to any interaction between a program and the outside world.
That "outside world" can be:
1. User â†’ typing on keyboard (input), seeing text on screen (output).
2. File system â†’ reading a file (input), writing a file (output).
3. Network â†’ receiving a request from the internet (input), sending a response (output).
4. Devices â†’ sending data to a printer, reading from a camera, etc.

ðŸ”¹ Why I/O is Special?
CPU operations (like 2 + 2 or sorting an array) are very fast (nanoseconds).
I/O operations are slow compared to CPU (milliseconds to seconds):
Reading from disk: micro to milliseconds.
Sending a network request: milliseconds to seconds.
Waiting for a user: could be forever ðŸ˜….
