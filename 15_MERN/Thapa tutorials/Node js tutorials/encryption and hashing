1.ENCRYPTION 
it is a two way communication
it is not a secure method because u can decode the encripted value and easily find the real value 


ANIL ---> encode [234asdfas234]
[234asdfas234] decode ---> ANIL





2.HASHING
it is a one way communication
you are unable to decode it 
bcryptJs (round 12) - it will took 3 years to hack

ANIL ---> hash [2fh4fj1hg2f34hf2j3234g1lhl];
